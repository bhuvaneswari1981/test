After analyzing the production job queues, identified only four situations in the past month where batch jobs experienced startup delays due to capacity constraints. While these infrequent delays have had minimal operational impact, we can further improve reliability by configuring our batch compute environments to support multiple instance types. This change would provide automatic fallback options when specific instance types have limited availability
