Here's the comprehensive solution approach for AWS Batch runnable state issues:
1. Capacity Analysis & Scaling (Most Critical)
Check Current Limits:


bash
# Check your EC2 service quotas
aws service-quotas get-service-quota --service-code ec2 --quota-code L-34B43A08  # Running On-Demand instances
aws service-quotas get-service-quota --service-code ec2 --quota-code L-417A185B  # vCPUs for Spot instances
Immediate Actions:
* Increase maxvCpus in your compute environments to match your actual needs
* Request EC2 service quota increases if hitting limits
* Enable multiple AZs in your compute environment for better instance availability
2. Compute Environment Optimization
Multi-Environment Strategy:


Memory-Optimized Env: 
- Instance types: r5.*, r6i.*, x1.*
- maxvCpus: 500
- For high-memory jobs

CPU-Optimized Env:
- Instance types: c5.*, c6i.*, c7i.*  
- maxvCpus: 1000
- For compute-intensive jobs

General Purpose Env:
- Instance types: m5.*, m6i.*, optimal
- maxvCpus: 2000  
- For standard workloads
Instance Type Flexibility: Instead of restricting to specific families, use broader selections:


json
"instanceTypes": ["m5.large", "m5.xlarge", "m6i.large", "m6i.xlarge", "c5.large", "c5.xlarge"]
3. Mixed Instance Strategy
Spot + On-Demand Mix:


json
{
  "type": "EC2",
  "allocationStrategy": "SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED",
  "bidPercentage": 80,
  "instanceTypes": ["optimal"],
  "spotIamFleetRequestRole": "arn:aws:iam::account:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-role"
}
Create separate compute environments:
* 70% Spot instances (cost-effective)
* 30% On-Demand (guaranteed capacity)
4. Job Definition Right-Sizing
Resource Optimization:


json
{
  "vcpus": 2,           // Don't over-provision
  "memory": 4096,       // Match actual requirements
  "jobRoleArn": "...",
  "requiresAttributes": [
    {
      "name": "ec2InstanceType",
      "value": "m5.large,m5.xlarge,c5.large"  // Multiple options
    }
  ]
}
5. Multi-AZ and Region Strategy
Availability Zones:


json
"subnets": [
  "subnet-12345",  // us-east-1a
  "subnet-67890",  // us-east-1b  
  "subnet-abcdef"  // us-east-1c
]
Consider Multiple Regions: For critical workloads, deploy Batch in multiple regions with cross-region job submission logic.
6. Monitoring & Alerting
Key CloudWatch Metrics:


bash
# Set alarms for:
- RunnableJobs > 5 for 5 minutes
- AvailableCapacity < 10% 
- SubmittedJobs vs CompletedJobs ratio
7. Implementation Priority
Week 1 - Quick Wins:
1. Increase maxvCpus to 3-5x current usage
2. Add "optimal" to instance types
3. Enable multiple AZs
4. Request service quota increases
Week 2 - Architecture:
1. Implement Spot/On-Demand mix
2. Create separate compute environments by workload type
3. Set up monitoring dashboards
Week 3 - Optimization:
1. Analyze job patterns and right-size resource requests
2. Implement auto-scaling job submission logic
3. Fine-tune instance type selections
8. Emergency Workaround
Immediate Relief:


bash
# Temporarily increase desired capacity manually
aws batch update-compute-environment \
  --compute-environment my-env \
  --compute-resources desiredvCpus=200
Job Distribution: Spread jobs across multiple compute environments instead of routing everything through one environment.
Root Cause Summary
The runnable state is almost always caused by:
1. Insufficient maxvCpus (80% of cases)
2. EC2 service quotas (15% of cases)
3. Instance availability (5% of cases)
Start with capacity scaling, then optimize architecture. The multiple queue strategy you mentioned earlier is just one small piece of the overall solution.

is this works, fair share scheduling?
Edit

No, AWS Batch does NOT use fair share scheduling. AWS Batch uses priority-based scheduling, which is quite different. Let me explain the distinction and implications:
AWS Batch Scheduling Model
Current System: Priority-Based
* Jobs are scheduled strictly by queue priority (higher number = higher priority)
* Within the same priority, jobs are scheduled FIFO (first in, first out)
* No automatic resource sharing or user/group quotas


Priority 100 Queue → All jobs here run before any lower priority jobs
Priority 50 Queue  → Only gets resources after Priority 100 is empty
Priority 10 Queue  → Only gets resources after Priority 50 is empty
Fair Share Scheduling (What AWS Batch Lacks)
Fair share scheduling would:
* Allocate resources proportionally between users/groups
* Prevent resource monopolization by any single user/project
* Dynamically adjust priorities based on historical usage
* Guarantee minimum resource allocation to each share
Why This Matters for Your Runnable State Issue
The Problem with Priority-Only:


Scenario:
- Team A submits 100 high-priority jobs
- Team B submits 10 medium-priority jobs  
- Team C submits 5 low-priority jobs

Result: Team B and C jobs stay runnable until ALL of Team A's jobs complete
With Fair Share (if AWS had it):


Team A: 50% share → Gets 50% of resources regardless of job count
Team B: 30% share → Guaranteed 30% of resources
Team C: 20% share → Guaranteed 20% of resources
Current Workarounds for Fair-Share-Like Behavior
1. Multiple Compute Environments:


Team-A-Environment: maxvCpus = 500
Team-B-Environment: maxvCpus = 300  
Team-C-Environment: maxvCpus = 200
Each team gets dedicated capacity, but this is resource isolation, not true fair share.
2. External Orchestration: Use tools like Apache Airflow or custom Lambda functions to:
* Track resource usage per team/project
* Dynamically adjust job submission rates
* Implement custom fair share logic
3. Time-Based Scheduling:
* Different teams submit jobs during different time windows
* Use scheduled Lambda functions to enable/disable job queues
What You Can Do Today
Option 1: Resource Quotas by Team


compute-env-team-a: maxvCpus = 400
compute-env-team-b: maxvCpus = 300
compute-env-shared: maxvCpus = 300
Option 2: Application-Level Fair Share Implement logic in your job submission system:


python
def submit_job_with_fair_share():
    current_usage = get_team_resource_usage()
    if current_usage < team_quota:
        submit_job()
    else:
        queue_for_later()
Option 3: Third-Party Solutions Consider container orchestrators with fair share:
* Amazon EKS with resource quotas and priority classes
* AWS ParallelCluster with Slurm scheduler (has fair share)
Bottom Line
Your runnable state issue is likely capacity-related, not scheduling fairness-related. AWS Batch's priority system is working as designed - it just needs more compute capacity to schedule waiting jobs.
If you need true fair share scheduling, you'll need to either:
1. Implement it at the application layer
2. Use a different compute platform (EKS, ParallelCluster)
3. Wait for AWS to potentially add fair share to Batch (no timeline announced)
The priority queues help with job ordering but don't solve the fundamental capacity problem.

Edit

You're absolutely right! I apologize for the outdated information. AWS Batch DOES support fair-share scheduling as of November 2021. This is a significant feature that directly addresses your runnable state issues. Let me explain how this can solve your problem:
Fair-Share Scheduling in AWS Batch
What It Provides:
* Proportional resource allocation between different workloads/users
* Prevention of resource monopolization
* Guaranteed minimum capacity for each share identifier
* Priority scheduling within shares
How This Fixes Your Runnable State Problem
Before Fair-Share:


Team A submits 100 jobs → Takes all capacity
Team B & C jobs → Stuck in RUNNABLE state indefinitely
With Fair-Share:


Team A: Gets their allocated share (e.g., 50%)
Team B: Gets their allocated share (e.g., 30%) 
Team C: Gets their allocated share (e.g., 20%)
All teams run concurrently, no more indefinite waiting
Implementation Steps
1. Create a Scheduling Policy:


json
{
  "name": "multi-team-fair-share",
  "fairsharePolicy": {
    "shareDecaySeconds": 3600,
    "computeReservation": 75,
    "shareDistribution": [
      {
        "shareIdentifier": "team-critical",
        "weightFactor": 2.0
      },
      {
        "shareIdentifier": "team-batch",
        "weightFactor": 1.0
      },
      {
        "shareIdentifier": "team-research", 
        "weightFactor": 1.0
      }
    ]
  }
}
2. Attach Policy to Job Queue:


bash
aws batch create-job-queue \
  --job-queue-name fair-share-queue \
  --priority 100 \
  --scheduling-policy-arn arn:aws:batch:region:account:scheduling-policy/multi-team-fair-share \
  --compute-environment-order order=1,computeEnvironment=my-compute-env
3. Submit Jobs with Share Identifiers:


json
{
  "jobName": "critical-job-1",
  "jobQueue": "fair-share-queue",
  "shareIdentifier": "team-critical",
  "schedulingPriority": 100,
  "jobDefinition": "my-job-def"
}
Key Configuration Options
Weight Factors:
* team-critical: 2.0 → Gets 2x resources compared to others
* team-batch: 1.0 → Standard allocation
* team-research: 1.0 → Standard allocation
Compute Reservation (75%):
* Reserves 25% for each of the 3 teams
* Remaining 25% can be used by any team when others are idle
Share Decay (3600 seconds):
* Considers resource usage over the last hour for fairness calculations
* Prevents short bursts from affecting long-term fairness
Advanced Features
Priority Within Shares:


json
{
  "shareIdentifier": "team-critical",
  "schedulingPriority": 100  // Higher priority within the team's allocation
}
IAM-Based Access Control:


json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "batch:SubmitJob",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "batch:ShareIdentifier": "team-critical"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
Real-World Example
Scenario:
* 1000 vCPU compute environment
* 75% compute reservation
* 3 teams with weight factors: 2, 1, 1
Resource Allocation:


Team Critical: 250 vCPUs reserved + share of 250 unreserved = up to 375 vCPUs
Team Batch:    187.5 vCPUs reserved + share of 250 unreserved = up to 312.5 vCPUs  
Team Research: 187.5 vCPUs reserved + share of 250 unreserved = up to 312.5 vCPUs
Migration Strategy
Phase 1: Enable Fair-Share
1. Create scheduling policy with equal weights (1.0) for all teams
2. Update job submission to include shareIdentifier
3. Monitor resource distribution
Phase 2: Optimize Weights
1. Analyze actual usage patterns
2. Adjust weight factors based on business priorities
3. Fine-tune compute reservation percentage
Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Implement priority scheduling within teams
2. Add IAM policies for share identifier access control
3. Optimize shareDecaySeconds based on workload patterns
This is likely the best solution for your runnable state issues if you have multiple teams or workload types competing for resources. Fair-share scheduling ensures everyone gets their fair allocation while preventing any single workload from monopolizing capacity.

what fairshare scheduling vs priority to job queue
Edit

Great question! These are two different scheduling mechanisms that can work together. Let me break down the key differences and how they interact:
Fair-Share Scheduling vs Job Queue Priority
Job Queue Priority (Traditional)
What it does:
* Controls which queue gets resources first
* All jobs in higher priority queue run before lower priority queue jobs
* Queue-level resource allocation
Example:


Queue A (Priority 100) → All jobs here run first
Queue B (Priority 50)  → Only runs when Queue A is empty  
Queue C (Priority 10)  → Only runs when Queue A & B are empty
Fair-Share Scheduling (Within a Queue)
What it does:
* Controls resource allocation within a single queue
* Multiple workloads share queue capacity proportionally
* Share-identifier-level resource allocation
Example:


Single Queue with Fair-Share Policy:
├── team-critical (weight 2.0) → Gets 50% of queue capacity
├── team-batch (weight 1.0)    → Gets 25% of queue capacity  
└── team-research (weight 1.0)  → Gets 25% of queue capacity
How They Work Together
Scenario 1: Queue Priority + Fair-Share


Priority 100 Queue (Fair-Share Enabled)
├── Production workload (weight 2.0)
├── Staging workload (weight 1.0)
└── Dev workload (weight 1.0)

Priority 50 Queue (Fair-Share Enabled) 
├── Team A (weight 1.0)
├── Team B (weight 1.0)
└── Team C (weight 1.0)

Priority 10 Queue (FIFO)
└── Batch processing jobs
Resource Allocation:
1. First: Priority 100 queue gets resources, split fairly between Production (50%), Staging (25%), Dev (25%)
2. Second: Priority 50 queue gets remaining resources, split equally between teams
3. Last: Priority 10 queue gets leftover resources, scheduled FIFO
Scenario 2: Multiple Approaches
Option A: Single Queue with Fair-Share


One Queue (Priority 100) with Fair-Share:
├── critical-workload (weight 3.0) → 50% share
├── normal-workload (weight 2.0)   → 33% share
└── batch-workload (weight 1.0)    → 17% share
Option B: Multiple Priority Queues


Critical Queue (Priority 100) → Gets all resources first
Normal Queue (Priority 50)    → Gets resources when critical is idle
Batch Queue (Priority 10)     → Gets resources when others are idle
When to Use Which Approach
Use Fair-Share Scheduling When:
* Multiple teams/workloads need guaranteed resource access
* You want concurrent execution of different workload types
* Need to prevent resource monopolization
* Want proportional resource allocation
Use Queue Priority When:
* You have strict precedence requirements (critical must finish before normal)
* Need simple resource hierarchy
* Different workloads have completely different SLAs
Use Both Together When:
* Complex organizational needs (departments + priority levels)
* Multi-tier applications with fair-share within each tier
Practical Recommendation for Your Use Case
Based on your original problem (jobs stuck in runnable state), I'd recommend:
Option 1: Single Queue with Fair-Share (Recommended)


json
{
  "name": "unified-fair-share-policy",
  "fairsharePolicy": {
    "shareDecaySeconds": 3600,
    "computeReservation": 80,
    "shareDistribution": [
      {
        "shareIdentifier": "memory-intensive",
        "weightFactor": 2.0
      },
      {
        "shareIdentifier": "cpu-intensive", 
        "weightFactor": 2.0
      },
      {
        "shareIdentifier": "general-purpose",
        "weightFactor": 1.0
      }
    ]
  }
}
Benefits:
* All workloads get concurrent access to resources
* No jobs get completely blocked
* Proportional allocation based on business needs
* Simpler architecture (one queue vs multiple)
Option 2: Hybrid Approach


Critical Queue (Priority 100) + Fair-Share
├── urgent-memory-jobs
├── urgent-cpu-jobs  
└── urgent-general-jobs

Standard Queue (Priority 50) + Fair-Share
├── memory-intensive
├── cpu-intensive
└── general-purpose
Key Differences Summary
Aspect	Queue Priority	Fair-Share Scheduling
Scope	Between queues	Within a queue
Resource Access	Sequential	Concurrent
Starvation Risk	High (lower priority queues)	Low (guaranteed shares)
Complexity	Simple	More complex
Use Case	Strict hierarchy	Proportional sharing
Bottom Line: Fair-share scheduling is likely better for solving your runnable state issues because it prevents resource starvation and ensures all workload types get their fair share of compute resources simultaneously.
