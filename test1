CDK CLI and Construct Library Version Split Update
📋 Overview
This PR updates our CDK installation and dependency management to align with AWS CDK's new versioning strategy, where the CLI and Construct Library are no longer released in lockstep starting February 2025.
🔄 What Changed in AWS CDK

Before: CDK CLI and Construct Library had the same version (e.g., both 2.174.0)
After: They have independent release cycles with different version numbers:

CLI: 2.1000.0, 2.1001.0, 2.1002.0... (new numbering scheme)
Library: 2.175.0, 2.176.0, 2.177.0... (continues current numbering)



🎯 Compatibility Rule

New Rule: CLI release date >= Library release date
Recommendation: Keep CLI at latest version (^2) and pin Library to specific versions
Backward Compatible: New CLI versions support all previous Library versions

📁 Files Modified
1. buildspec.yml (or build configuration)
Changed installation approach:
yaml# Before (Single version for both)
- export CDK_VERSION="2.174.0"
- npm install -g aws-cdk@$CDK_VERSION
- pip install aws-cdk-lib==$CDK_VERSION

# After (Separate versioning)
- export AWS_CDK_CLI_VERSION="^2"           # Always latest CLI
- export AWS_CDK_LIB_VERSION="2.179.0"     # Pin Library version
- npm install -g aws-cdk@$AWS_CDK_CLI_VERSION
- pip install aws-cdk-lib==$AWS_CDK_LIB_VERSION
2. requirements.txt
Updated CDK library dependency:
txt# Uses environment variable for flexible version management
aws-cdk-lib==${AWS_CDK_LIB_VERSION}
constructs>=10.0.0,<11.0.0
✅ What Didn't Change

No Python code changes: All imports remain from aws_cdk import ...
No cdk.json changes: Configuration stays identical
No application logic changes: CDK app functionality unchanged
Same deployment process: cdk deploy, cdk synth work exactly the same

🔧 Technical Details

CLI Package: aws-cdk (Node.js) - Tool for running CDK commands
Library Package: aws-cdk-lib (Python) - Code we import in our applications
Separation: CLI handles deployment, Library defines infrastructure
Compatibility: Latest CLI (^2) works with all Library versions we use

🎯 Benefits

Future-proof: Aligned with AWS CDK's new release strategy
Flexibility: Can update CLI and Library independently
Stability: Pinned Library versions ensure consistent builds
Compatibility: No breaking changes to existing functionality

✨ Impact Assessment

Zero code changes required in Python CDK applications
Zero runtime impact - same CloudFormation templates generated
Improved maintainability with cleaner version management
Ready for future CDK updates without version conflicts
